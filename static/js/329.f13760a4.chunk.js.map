HTML was used to structure the game board, buttons,\r\n          and other elements of the user interface. CSS was utilized to add\r\n          styling, including colors, fonts, and layout, to enhance the visual\r\n          appeal and user experience.{\" \"}\r\n          <span>\r\n            JavaScript played a crucial role in implementing the game logic\r\n          </span>{\" \"}\r\n          , handling player moves, checking for win conditions.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          It also facilitated user interactions and provided real-time feedback\r\n          during gameplay.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I really hope to come back and add the computer's AI for single-player\r\n          mode.{\" \"}\r\n          <span>\r\n            I deployed the site on Github pages for it's free hosting since it\r\n            didn't carry much file size.\r\n          </span>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Problems and Thought Process</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>Game Logic:</span>\r\n          Implementing the game logic, including validating moves, checking for\r\n          win conditions, required careful planning and attention to detail. I\r\n          had to think through different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the\r\n          game behaved correctly and provided a fair and enjoyable experience\r\n          for players. Considering that I had not played Tic Tac Toe before I\r\n          had to read about how it's played and lean whilst developing it.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>User Interface and Experience:</span> Designing an intuitive and\r\n          visually appealing user interface was important to enhance the overall\r\n          experience. I had to consider how to visually represent the game\r\n          board, handle player input, and provide clear feedback to indicate the\r\n          current game state. Creating an interactive and responsive layout that\r\n          worked well across different devices and screen sizes required\r\n          thoughtful design decisions and testing.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>Testing and Bug Fixing:</span> Thorough testing was crucial to\r\n          identify and fix any bugs or issues that arose during development. I\r\n          conducted extensive testing to ensure the game functioned as intended,\r\n          resolved any unexpected behaviors, and optimized the performance for a\r\n          smooth and responsive gaming experience.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2>Lessons Learned & Future Work</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Developing a game involves designing and implementing complex logic\r\n          and algorithms. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding\r\n          of game mechanics, such as validating moves, checking for win\r\n          conditions. I learned the importance of thorough planning and testing\r\n          to ensure the game logic behaved as expected and provided a fair and\r\n          enjoyable experience for players.{\" \"}\r\n          <span>\r\n            The whole idea was to improved my code logic, and this was a great\r\n            test and it was well taken and well learned.\r\n          </span>\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"project_details\":\"project_project_details__m7Qre\",\"read_time\":\"project_read_time__i5uct\",\"project_resources\":\"project_project_resources__tgkNA\",\"project_desc_container\":\"project_project_desc_container__fKtCa\",\"project_img\":\"project_project_img__rboFU\",\"challenge_faced\":\"project_challenge_faced__Btjtm\",\"problem\":\"project_problem__vfwAh\",\"solution\":\"project_solution__TP085\"};"],"names":["TicTacToe","className","c","href","target","rel","src","process","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
