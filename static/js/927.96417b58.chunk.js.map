The primary goal was to build a dynamic web application\r\n          that allows users to discover, like and participate in meetup events\r\n          worldwide. By utilizing the power of React, I aimed to create an\r\n          interactive and seamless user experience. Additionally, integrating\r\n          Firebase API enabled the storage and retrieval of data submitted\r\n          through a form, providing a comprehensive solution for managing meetup\r\n          event information.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Web Stack and Explanation</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Meetup Finder was developed using{\" \"}\r\n          <span>HTML, CSS, React, and Firebase.</span> HTML provided the\r\n          structure of the web pages, while CSS was used to enhance the visual\r\n          appeal and ensure a user-friendly interface. React, a powerful\r\n          JavaScript library, allowed for the creation of reusable components,\r\n          efficient state management, and seamless routing using the\r\n          react-router-dom package. <span>Firebase,</span> a cloud-based\r\n          platform, provided the backend functionality for storing and\r\n          retrieving data through its API, ensuring a robust and scalable\r\n          solution for managing meetup event information.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Problems and Thought Process</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>Integrating Firebase API:</span> Incorporating Firebase API for\r\n          data storage and retrieval required understanding its documentation\r\n          and integrating it effectively into the React application. I had to\r\n          design and implement the necessary logic to handle form submissions,\r\n          securely store data, and retrieve information for displaying meetup\r\n          events dynamically.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>Enhanced React Skills:</span> Building a React application\r\n          provided an opportunity to enhance my skills in component-based\r\n          architecture, state management, and efficient rendering. I deepened my\r\n          understanding of React and its ecosystem, enabling me to build more\r\n          robust and scalable web applications in the future.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span>API Integration and Backend Development:</span> Integrating\r\n          Firebase API expanded my knowledge of backend development and working\r\n          with cloud-based services. I learned how to leverage APIs effectively\r\n          to handle data storage and retrieval, which opens up possibilities for\r\n          integrating other APIs and building more complex applications.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"project_details\":\"project_project_details__JERHM\",\"read_time\":\"project_read_time__KiIcK\",\"project_resources\":\"project_project_resources__ibWXj\",\"project_desc_container\":\"project_project_desc_container__MoIKW\",\"project_img\":\"project_project_img__Y-p6q\",\"challenge_faced\":\"project_challenge_faced__cmrVz\",\"problem\":\"project_problem__jarEf\",\"solution\":\"project_solution__FuPTd\"};"],"names":["MeetUp","className","c","href","target","rel","src","process","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
