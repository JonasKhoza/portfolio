I am a dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer with a burning\r\n          passion for technology and a relentless drive to learn and grow. My\r\n          journey into the world of programming began in a community where\r\n          access to computer resources was limited. However, my determination\r\n          pushed me to overcome these challenges and pursue my love for\r\n          technology.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Having gained access to computer resources later in life, I embarked\r\n          on a self-taught journey to master web development. While waiting for\r\n          my ID, I delved into various online platforms, including{\" \"}\r\n          <span>\r\n            Udemy, SoloLearn, W3Schools, YouTube tutorials, and even a\r\n            Full-Stack Web development course from Academind.com,\r\n          </span>{\" \"}\r\n          generously provided by a friend.

I enjoy\r\n          breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces, thoroughly\r\n          analyzing them, and deriving the most fitting solutions.\r\n          Problem-solving excites me, and I credit my love for solving intricate\r\n          math problems to an inspiring math teacher.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          In 2023, I joined the prestigious University of South Africa to\r\n          further expand my knowledge and skills in the field of informatics.\r\n          Throughout my studies, I have immersed myself in various subjects,\r\n          including{\" \"}\r\n          <span>\r\n            Python and C++ programming, Foundations of Computer Science, and\r\n            computer architecture.\r\n          </span>{\" \"}\r\n          These foundational courses have provided me with a solid understanding\r\n          of programming syntax, computational principles, and the inner\r\n          workings of computer systems.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          Looking ahead to 2024, I am excited to delve into the world of\r\n          <span>graphical user interfaces (GUI)</span> with both Python and C++.\r\n          This next phase of my education will enable me to enhance my skills in\r\n          creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, further enriching my\r\n          capabilities as a full-stack web developer.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n          While my focus is on software development, my ultimate goal is to\r\n          become a<span>data scientist.</span> The field of data science\r\n          fascinates me, as it combines my love for technology with the power of\r\n          data analysis and insights.
