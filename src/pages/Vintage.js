        <h2>Project Purpose and Goal</h2>
        <p>
          Designed the architecture from frontend to backend to create a website
          that combines the best of modern web development to deliver a
          lightning-fast website. The main focus here was speed and security. To
          add a bit of sophistication, I added features like product reviewing,
          product search, database indexing, order tracking, and all other
          e-commerce features, including authentication and authorization making
          use of cookies, and a built-in admin panel
          <span>
            to offer the best user experience of modern e-commerce website.
          </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Web Stack and Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          Built the project using a blend of React because of its powerful
          server-side rendering and dynamic routing and it's ability to power
          modern web development to deliver a lightning-fast website. The use of{" "}
          <span>TypeScript</span> ensures robust type-checking, enabling a more
          reliable and maintainable codebase. The backend is powered by{" "}
          <span>Express with TypeScript</span> to power the REST API.
          Authentication was built using{" "}
          <span>JWT and express-session and connect-mongodb-express</span> was
          used to handle cart functionalities and the use of{" "}
          <span>cookies</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the databse I used <span>MongoDB.</span> I generated the{" "}
          <span>MongoDB schema using Mongoose.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure code stability and site performance, I implemented
          TypeScript type-checking, React performance optimization with lazy
          loading, react hooks, a well thought database schema.
        </p>
        <h2>Problems and Thought Process</h2>
        <p>
          While building Vintage, I paid special attention to the design of
          Mongoose schemas, ensuring a solid foundation for the backend.
          <span>However, challenges </span>arose when it came to handling user
          addresses.{" "}
          <span>
            I happen to have separated the User schema from the Address schema
            and leaving no link at all on User schema but providing one on the
            Address schema.
          </span>{" "}
          In retrospect, incorporating a default address within the User schema
          could have simplified the process, eliminating the need for separate
          address mappings. Nonetheless, I made efficient use of separate
          queries to retrieve addresses when necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons Learned & Future Work</h2>
        <p>
          In addition, tackling the frontend-server connection proved to be a
          learning experience. From initially using CORS with specific options
          to enable cross-origin requests, upon CORS not working, I refined the
          solution to allow the frontend application origin, support
          credentials, specify allowed HTTP methods, and define allowed
          headersâ€”fostering seamless communication between the React frontend
          and the server.
          <span>
            The truth of software development is there's never a one way to kill
            a rat and this is the most beautiful part of it.
